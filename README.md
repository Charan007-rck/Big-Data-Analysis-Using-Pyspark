This file is about to count the number of repeated words in the entire data.
The data is included in code itself.
I have imported the data/content from the url.
URL = "https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/7213/pg7213.txt"
From the above url you can find the data,from there we can find the number of repeated words in the data.
